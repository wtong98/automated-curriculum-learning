# Adaptive algorithms for shaping behavior

This code accompanies [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.03.569774v1), implementing the main algorithms and reproducing the core results.

The `sequence_env` directory contains implementations relevant to the sequence learning task. The `trail_env` directory contains implementations for the deep RL task, and corresponding teacher algorithms. Included in both directories are Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the numeric figures in the main text.
